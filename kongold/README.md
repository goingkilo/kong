war maven skeleton
rest
hibernate


spring?
jpa?
jboss ?

Now there's a fully dependencified maven web application (WAR!) connecting to postgres via hibernate annotations, 
(todo:encryt password), a REST section implemention add and get notes respectively (by notebook name (todo: need to 
add notebook name/id to the entity))
and a html page which lets the user add a note and see existing notes.
The paradigm in GAE is different in the sense that if the total number of entries is not handled when entering
a note, then there's no way of getting it  - no select count(*) .
so we'd better start with a metadata entity.

also understand that I need an EJB now.

how will I post pics taken from android ?

what I want - groovy AND clojure scripting facility and interfaces

next: populate list of notes using $ajax and json
implement Notebook info, notes metadata


***
Fill.in can be done using reflection
so can a class diagram
tough to do is the sequence diagram ? 


Kong:
next steps: 
add users, notebook names etc
an ejb to handle db work ?

groovy script facility
to start with a groovy ranprieur/ribbonfarm/xx slurper, triggered by Quartz :D
then jsoup to display the links
also display an i ching in the top (right?)


we also want a wit.ai voice console

we also want to make ppts describing what we've done.

we want a decent android app on hte market. we paid OC $25 for this.

we want to auto generate test cases

Android can use a recursive file system mapper. Astro file editor sucks

piece de resistance` : pulse based song selection based on bpm (or beat generation)

large code base tool
astex  object diff  notebooks(html+code)
