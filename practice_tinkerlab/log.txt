It's almost a year since I started with this. It's time to revisit stuck-in-a-rut projects and ease them over psychological humps.
(cheat-nothing eases things over a rut than a workout). I had given up, at last count, on authentication, and had ground everything to a halt.
 This time, we will revisit stuff ,but one by one, and with single-stretch goals at a time, on each.

## old stuff I will ignore ##
lists
crud with json and html
create screen 
four lists
need a servlet filter
    authentication and users
